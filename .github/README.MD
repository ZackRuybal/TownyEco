# What is TownyEco?
TownyEco is a plugin developed by Lukas Mansour (Articdive) to add dynamic economies to Minecraft [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny) Servers, however since release the plugin has been standalone allowing it to be used without Towny. It is a from scratch coded economy plugin based on [HyperConomy](https://github.com/RegalOwl/HyperConomy).
