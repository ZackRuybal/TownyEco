# Code Guidelines

- Use Java 8 syntax and streams in normal cases
- Avoid magic values
- Include our license in the top of the class using inline comments "//"
- No Wildcard imports
- Only one top-level class
- Format Comments for easy readability.
- Avoid using ternary operators
- The code style (spaces, bracket-locations e.t.c) are very similar to the default settings of IntelliJ.  
  When in doubt look at how other classes were formatted, if the code style isn't perfect it isn't a severe problem
  just avoid writing your entire commit in a different code style. Example: Don't write your entire commit with ";" on the next line.
